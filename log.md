**Today's Progress**: Researched Weather APIs for the Weather application. 

**Thoughts**: Its really difficult to analyse and pick an API. Learning to use APIs can be tricky.

### Day 3 : Jan 3rd, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Built JSON code for Weather App project.

**Thoughts**: APIs can be tricky because they are not served over hpps. Need to be careful when choosing apis.

### Day 4 : Jan 4th, 2017
